To start, users can search for their favorite recipes (in this case we are looking for pizza). Users can also filter the searches by 
- meal time (breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert)
- difficulty (easy, medium, hard)
- time to complete (15 mins, 30 mins, 1 hour)

They will then get a list of recipes that matches their selection!
